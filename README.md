# Meal Tracking
This little library will help with meal and macro tracking throughout the day.

## Current status
__10/19/2020__: So far, this is just a small Node-only library with very simple
macro "math." I find myself typing these calculations out so frequently that I
wanted a class to handle it all.

## Next goals
* Build out a daily macro goal calculator based on current weight, calorie goal
  and type of exercise day (rest, light, medium, heavy).
